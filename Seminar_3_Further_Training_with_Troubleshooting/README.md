# Further Training with Containers

The structure for this seminar will be a short lecture talking about the topic and then a live demonstration that everyone should be able to follow along.

What's needed:

- This github repository.
- Docker installed (to follow along with the example).
- Docker Hub account (to follow along with the example).
- Willingness to learn and an open mind.
