# Troubleshooting Demo

The goal of this demonstration is to create a Docker image that has R and the DESeq2 package, based from a Ubuntu image.

## Finding a Docker Image

- A Docker image needs to be found to base the image off of.
- Best places to look:
    - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
    - [RIS Supported Docker Image](https://docs.ris.wustl.edu/doc/compute/recipes/ris-supported-containers.html)
- Search Docker Hub to find an image. [Docker Hub Ubuntu Image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/ubuntu/jammy/images/sha256-0eb0f877e1c869a300c442c41120e778db7161419244ee5cbc6fa5f134e74736?context=explore)
- Search RIS docs to find an image. [RIS Ubuntu Image](https://docs.ris.wustl.edu/doc/compute/recipes/tools/novnc-dockerimage.html#available-versions)
![](images/finding_ubuntu_image.png)

## Creating the Docker Image

- Create a Dockerfile using the image as a base. (Using base ubuntu image as the example)
```
#Use Ubuntu 22.04 as base
FROM ubuntu:22.04
```
- Find out how to install R in a Docker image.
![](images/search.for.r.install.png)
![](images/stack.overflow.install.png)
```
#Install R
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y r-base
```
- Now that R is installed, the image can be built.
- We need to run the following command from within the same folder/directory as the Dockerfile.
```
docker build -t elynrfw/docker-example:09-19-24 .
```
![](images/r-asking-for-region.png)
- It looks like the installation of R is asking for a region, but we can't respond to this and the image creation gets stuck.
- How do we fix this?
![](images/prompt-search.png)
![](images/noninteractive-command.png)
- Let's add that to our command.
```
RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y r-base
```
- Now we can try again.
![](images/first-docker-build.png)
- The output from Docker is in a kind of short form. Can we see more? What if there's an error and we need to know more?
- Let's start with the Docker build help info.
```

```
- Looking at the help, we can see that the `--progress` option is going to give us what we want if we set it to plain.
- Let's try that and look at the difference.
```
docker build --progress=plain -t elynrfw/docker-example:09-19-24 .
```
![](images/cached-progress.png)
- As we can see here, Docker uses a caching system to save on time and space.
- We don't necessarily want that when we're building an image, how do we change it?
- Looking back at the build options, we can see that there's an option for that.
```
--no-cache                      Do not use cache when building the image
```
- Let's add that to our build command.
```
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t elynrfw/docker-example:08-13-24 .
```
![](images/plain-build.png)
- There's a lot of output from this, but it's all necessary if we want to troubleshoot and debug.
- We could try piping the standard out to a log file.
```
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t elynrfw/docker-example:08-13-24 . > build.log
```
- As we can see from the output, this did not work.
![](images/carrot-build.png)
- Let's see if there's a way to make this work.
![](images/search-for-logs.png)
![](images/pipe-docker-examples.png)
- Based off what we found, our Docker build command should now look like the following.
```
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t elynrfw/docker-example:08-13-24 . &> build.log
```
- If we try that out, we can see that the output is now going to a file like we wanted.
![](images/pipe-function-working.png)
- Once the build finishes, we can look at our `build.log` file.
![](first-build-log.png)

## Expanding the Base Image

- Let's say we want to add an R package to our image.
- We know how to do this in R.
```
install.packages()
```
- But how do we make it work in Docker? Let's search!
![](images/install-r-package-search.png)
![](images/how-to-install-r-package.png)
- We've found out how to install a package in Docker, let's add it to our image.
```
#Install DeSeq2
RUN R -e "install.packages('deseq2',dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
```
- Let's run our Docker build.
- Once it is finished we can take a look at our log. We specifically want to see the section about installing DESeq2.
```

```
- From the log, we can see that R did not find the package.
- To the Google!
![](images/search-to-install-deseq2.png)
![](images/how-to-install-deseq2.png)
- Based off the information here, we need to install Biocmanager and use that to install DESeq2.
- Our install code should now look like the following.
```
#Install DeSeq2
RUN R -e "install.packages('biocmanager',dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
RUN R -e "BiocManager::install('DESeq2')"
```
- Try to build with the new Dockerfile.
```
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t elynrfw/docker-example:08-13-24 . &> build.log
```
- Note, that as we change our Dockerfile, we don't have to change our build command.
- Let's take a look at the log.
- At the end of the file, we can see a list of errors.
```

```
- It looks like a lot of dependencies that DESeq2 needs are not installing properly.
- We can find each section that has an error by running a cat piped into a grep.
```
cat build.log | grep "ERROR"
```
- Running this, we can see many sections that have an error.
```

```
- The numbers at the beginning of the line give the section and subsection. We can grep for those to figure out the error.
```
cat build.log | grep "#7 133.1"

#7 133.1 Using PKG_LIBS=-lcurl

#7 133.1  * rpm: libcurl-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
#7 133.1 If libcurl is already installed, check that 'pkg-config' is in your
#7 133.1 PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains a libcurl.pc file. If pkg-config
#7 133.1 is unavailable you can set INCLUDE_DIR and LIB_DIR manually via:
#7 133.1 R CMD INSTALL --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=... LIB_DIR=...'
#7 133.1 -------------------------- [ERROR MESSAGE] ---------------------------

#7 133.1 ERROR: configuration failed for package 'curl'
#7 133.1 * removing '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/curl'
```
- From this, we can see that the first error shows that we need a library installed.
- It even tells us what library to install.
```
#7 133.1  * deb: libcurl4-openssl-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
```
- We can add that to our Dockerfile in the following line.
```
RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y r-base libcurl4-openssl-dev
```
- Let's run the build again.
- Once it's done we can use the grep for "ERROR" again to see what exists yet.
```

#8 562.2 ERROR: dependencies 'genefilter', 'geneplotter' are not available for package 'DESeq2'
```
- Just that 1 additional library fixed a few of the errors.
- Let's take a look at the error for XML, `#8 99.11`.
```
cat build.log | grep "#8 99.11"
#8 99.11 ERROR: configuration failed for package 'XML'
#8 99.11 * removing '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/XML'
```
- There's not a lot there but we can just grep for  `#8 99` and see if that expands the info.
```
#8 99.04 checking how to run the C preprocessor... gcc -E
#8 99.09 checking for sed... /bin/sed
#8 99.09 checking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config

```
- Now we can see that it's looking for `xml2-config` but can't find it and it doesn't tell us what to install.
- To Google!
![](images/xml2-search.png)
![](images/how-to-install-xml.png)
- From this, we can see that we need another library. So we can update our command to include it.
```
RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y r-base libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev
```
- Run the build again!
- If we grep for ERROR, we can see that the XML error is gone but we still have a few.
- If we look closer, we can see that some of them rely on each other. Let's take a look at the `openssl` error.
```

- We can see that DESeq2 installed correctly and there were no errors listed after that.
- Congratulations! We have made it through all the troubleshooting required to create a Docker image with R and DESeq2.
